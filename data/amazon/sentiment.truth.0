washing is a pain and takes several hours .
this is definitely a terrible case .
Items arrived ten days late in bulk packaging exactly like J .
I bought three of these units and can't place them in our home .
I didn't like this and was unhappy with my purchase .
went looking for them and couldn't find them .
with low usage its closer to only 1 hour .
I don't want the burdensome bulk of an otterbox defender .
i made beef bolognese in the oven and it turned out horribly .
once glitch , which i did not view as all that positive .
synching is not too hard , with no passwords or codes required
i wore my first one out by using it normally .
I wouldn't buy this again even with one-day shipping .
coming from an asian background it is a very odd thing to cook with .
too complex and does not do the job it was intended for .
not a good choice for me
this is the old water filter pitcher
then both of them might go into the dishwasher
and it's a terrible bread knife .
open carefully and handle the zippers with care because they break .
It can't be tightened at that points its beyond broken .
some reviewers complained of grounds in the coffee , they were correct .
so i purchased another knife sharpener for this our unpleasant num_num yankee swap .
don't get it, it's for sure not worth the price
would have rather used filters
i received them as a christmas present and i like them
take the whole thing out in the trash .
the unit itself rests uncomfortably like a necklace around your neck .
Doesn't charge my phone well .
i dropped phone once and the case didn't hold up .
also, do not ever use that yellow cloth to clean your phone .
doesn't do the job
put horrible store bought pizza sauce on top then add old pepperonis and spoiled mushrooms
i have a few oxo products and have always been disappointed .
also, the knife is not easy to maneuver given its length .
it had a good cost and a nice product
I finally made the purchase, but I regretted it .
i paid over num_num cents plus shipping for this protective cover case .
place it in the freezer and try to close the door
i would definitely not recommend this for a cute case .
i purchased it from one of the first infomercials , not pleased .
i did not like the adjustable heat option for the warming plate .
belt works well enough and installed in a few minutes
not that stable
I couldn't give it five stars because of the very inadequate use of bubble wrap .
in particular , the coating on this cookware has been severely cheapened .
that s what it does and it does it not bad
i bought this to grind xylitol and truvia sweeteners into a powder for cooking and it does not serve its purpose .
you might like it, but you probably won t .
unfortunately signal between transmitter and receiver never works between insulated patio glass door
I have tried prongs that never fit between the cork
the margin of safety is very bad from overflow
It was difficult to apply and didn't' work well .
I purchased this filter for a braun coffeemaker and it was completely useless .
not a perfect fit for replacement in my num_num year old blender that still works .
doesn t get stuck too much on the rod like some non rollers do
once it dies i won't purchase this unit .
my wife despises window fans and she hates this thing too .
i never use it a lot, it always gives me problems .
my dish feels very flimsy to the touch
so far has not lasted for a long time and wears off .
didn't follow the guide
I can't hear the caller clearly , vice versa .
i would never suggest this on black iphones .
not blocking the red hot coils from my cookie sheets , and glassware .
other then that major problem, this is a terrible heddest .
i imagine it won't make soups as well as the old one .
so , to me this is almost instant
i have had this mount for about a year and it works okay .
The cheap charger does not do the job .
then i knew there were something terribly wrong with my car .
i cant remember why i first bought this timer .
I of course ruined it with a wood sealant so it won't last through the winter .
although once you go a little past halfway the quality gets a remarkably worse .
I ordered it and it was delivered many days past the expected time .
i mainly use my blentec now but i am looking for something better .
it was nice that within a minute incorporated all ingredients to perfection
i finally received a replacement bb curve from verizon
terrible to have a burner going on for hours .
of course the german s call this sort of idea bad engineering .
not very durable and seems similar quality to apple products
it slips all over the place when using .
and it will not keep your rice hot or edible for any amount of time .
the last time i did it was years and years ago .
money wasted i think
most pizza wheels that i ve seen are much unpleasantly smaller .
the price was high, and came quickly though my prime membership .
it does not hold a charge at all, nothing like when it was new
these small cookie scoops fail to make perfectly uniform two inch cookies
it is isn't very easy to use and i have had some problems with it .
just do your homework and you will end up pretty dismayed .
i can t believe how weak this little guy is .
I hate the oster steamer, it does nothing it claimed to do .
the cheese never came out light and fluffy .
the finer the setting, it takes much longer .
i think this case is a very bad phone case .
i use this with afresh to clean a little my cook top
these wine stopper are very expensive and do not do the job .
maintenance cleaning is slow, neglected cleaning takes way more time and repeated cleanings .
i have smaller bt headsets that last many, many hours longer
we are ice cream lovers and and fussy about the quality and this item is terrible when it comes to quality
so shipping takes a while but it is definitely not worth the price .
I have several of these, it's not worth it .
i bought this in num_num and the pan is already in horrible shape .
short blades and longer handles give you almost all the leverage you need for tough cutting
it won't stay on so i unplug it when it s done .
just wipe the horrid plates with a paper towel .
dash mounts are either very bulky and in the way or not nearly strong enough
you need to use the towel it comes with to clean the phone before placement
I made the mistake of purchasing white rice popcorn
its actually a little worse than the filter that came with the unit .
it's a mediocre quality at an inflated price .
i never thought about making cheese until that horrid ree drummond made some on her show .
i have them in different locations in my house
the flap also is not good and comes loose often .
this product does not do what it is supposed to do .
after several days, the contents of the wine bottle weren't air tight .
i have had lots of problems with the teflon flaking off .
it does not move much air .
unless you have normal sized hands it is uncomfortable to use .
it was the finger next to his injured hole finger .
this does not get the job done and it is expensive .
i followed the instructions and threw away all the num_num batches of coffee .
doesn t reduce at all the fat anymore than most cooking methods
lots of negatives including the delifery was num_num days late .
too many trips to refill
it seems to be of very poor quality in its build
took a while to boil
i won't be ordering a second one in the future
i am happy that i did not spend a full fortune on the electric models
the instructions came over the motorola num_extend and were clear enough
doesn't work with evo
The vacuum sealing worked nothing like advertised .
don't like the braun
it plugs the ipad into my car and does not work .
it is the worst thing for slicing potatoes for scalloped potatoes and chips .
however, this is an example of how rosie got it wrong .
i don t know how i will manage with this devise .
pretty much almost all i ask for in a grinder
you try to place all the ingredients into the bread maker
the charger is so far working with my wireless bluetooth speaker
the head set is not very comfortable at least for me
one hour per slice seems like a awful pace so far .
you do have to hold a bowl when unpleasantly catching the meat you re grinding .
but for now, I'm very displeased with this .
wrapped around me very difficultly to tuck in getting ready at the gym .
the grill surface is more difficult to clean than our other grills .
sometimes i m there for an endless number of hours .
if you need a pot with this capacity num_extend qts do not buy this one .
look up videos on swype if you want to see it doing badly
it was just one that frankly that's a big deal .
it does not work great and i am extremely unhappy with it .
no too many problems with this and worked with a few devices
both english and metric measurements are present onto each spoon
we somehow juiced our garden lettuce and greens
bad fit , with all the buttons and holes incorrectly aligned .
i didn't get this as a gift for my son .
will never become soft with use .
odd people all around me
I have both a square and round pan this won't work with .
finish is horrible , and it makes bad french toast .
that is a major flaw and affects my rating .
doesn't keep the air nice
puts together with great difficulty and doesn't do what it said it would .
hand graters are a huge mess to clean , especially under the handle
apparently there are a lot more words required to successfully submit this review
this was ruined when keeping it in the refrigerator for a couple of days .
don't like it . not handy to set by the stove .
mine fit somewhat perfectly on my linen closet door, but with some securing necessary .
we usually run it on low and it is very loud .
when purchased i discovered there was a worse product update : model num_extend
i sprinkle a little flour on the rolls before stamping to prevent sticking , but they still stick .
if you order it by itself, shipping is terribly expensive .
it would have been better if it wasn't way too big
it wont reconnect easily when you are in the num_extend
only bad things to say about this horrible innovation
I would not recommend this case to my friends .
mixer just as loud
the cord is very sensitive to tangling
for the size, weight, and price it isn't worth it .
i have not been missing out ! this thing is so dull
this is much more expensive that going to the grocery store
its like that showtime rotisserrie oven , after you get to set it you might forget it
The cover doesn't do what it is supposedly designed to do .
i feel like i have an old phone .
they were flimsy
i m starting to loathe it immensely because i don t need to upgrade .
do not recommend this at all
it is different to go to anything else now that i have used this
the fit isn't very good, cutouts aren't placed where they should be .
i have had to replace the paddles as they wore out
i though it would be faster and easier but it certainly wasn t .
but it's not good for wireless , i've never had worse .
as stated by the many reviews , this is a discreet carpet cleaner
the la prima ran about half a shot then broke the machine .
all came very dull and difficult to assemble .
auto shut off after num_num hours , which is a good feature , doesn't work .
and do not remove part one of the screen until part two is applied if you don't want big troubles
my kitchen appliances are horribly taken care of
anker, don't like it
too small
a gas cooktop would be way more worse and a smooth cooktop would probably not be much better .
anyway i do not recommend this one for its high price and low quality .
i purchased this to replace a knife that was broke .
this is the second one of these that i have had to purchase .
these tongs seem to have the locking mechanism backwards and don't work .
i have tried a lot of them and this was disappointing .
on the other hand for power grating it does not work .
i had two terrible problems, one caused the rating to num_num num_extend
everything seems to stick and it is something you need to worry about
didn't read any reviews
i used this set with a toaster oven and with a coleman camping oven and it caused a lot of difficulty .
i ve charged it multiple times since i bought it .
didn't save on cleaning or the use of aluminum foil .
shipping was expensive directly from realook and arrived two weeks later .
i have had two of these cans outside for a week and they no longer work .
there is no warming plate in the unit but you can even do without one
i believe it was expensive when it came to market .
this little butter bell is a terrible buy .
it does not pick up what is directly in front of it .
it isn't very hardy , it already broke .
product is poor choice
this item doesn't work as i thought it would
i would never even give some as gifts this holiday season .
shouldn't gotten something else
we have begrudgingly used ours at least a couple of hundred times .
i ve had to repair it too many times to count as it s % plastic .
i have been using this grill for just num_num years
i know pie weights are not for me .
it requires some genius to get this unit operating
its going terrible, I needed less capacity .
not what I thought
slow; worse than a blender and is tough to use .
can't core out a potato
i have had mine for almost two years and it is completely frayed .
it comes at a expensive price and appears to be cheaply made
terrible dutch oven, barely works and is a hassle to use on camping trips
died from the start
it would have been smart if it had a crank or something to make it easier
the shipping charges are now higher and missing on the order .
seems cheap plastic to me
this turner has worked pretty poorly for the last few years .
no warranty, bad deal
Then i got the zester which I never use .
i don't think that is the way to keep the fish moist
i have not been able to use it .
it has a more bulky feel as the other cases available .
that said , the mic did not pic up everything it could .
however , slicing up tons of veggies is quite time consuming
unfortunately , the remaining sticker is attached to the second film .
They don't work as well as expected .
because it is made of cast iron , scorching is maximized
i say that after trying many cheap pathetic headsets that I loathe , sigh .
i do seem to need to invest in some popcorn that doesn't suck .
for example , the box says there is no led battery indicator light .
i dislike my lodge omelet pan and rarely use it .
this is the worst cookware i've ever owned .
i bought the lowest priced model more to test the brand than anything else , and it was bad .
I have never found a use for these .
i can't believe i owned one of these before .
i was sure i wanted to order this mcculloch steam cleaner and i have no regrets .
can't be easily moved to various locations depending on need .
i would have given this five stars except for the few complaints i had
replaced my pampered chef garlic press with this piece of junk .
this headset is not so great , the sound quality is pretty mediocre .
the tiny green light on one side is way too bright when fully charged .
i had it a long time now and i still find it useful
I get oil all over my hands when cooking up a steak or falafel .
wow im happy with this device ! how useful it is
the glass cuisinart lids would pour water everywhere in a wet mess all the time .
I have realistic expectations of this device that were not met .
I'm sure this size cannot do a bigger bird than num_num pounds
it s very difficult and takes up a lot of space on the pot rack .
it does not work as advertised so i m angry! : .
i'mm not sure why this grinder got so many good reviews .
I have replaced it after two years because it is not a work horse .
it isn't easy to clean, but honestly I rarely clean it .
There is little choice of breads .
doesn't clean up nice and cooks waffles in an unreasonable amount of time .
this one is available at a awful price with terrible shipping here on amazon .
carrots leave an unsightly orange smear on the surface .
I can't see myself using it a lot .
i have always had bad experiences with the customer support at cuisnart
but i don't want the phone to be up higher on the windshield . not recommended .
i regret that i just bought a num_extend cubic ft chest freezer .
i would trade them because this is a horrible knife for the price .
horrible case, difficult to use and fragile .
it doesn't really work with all types , but doesn't work at all with roma tomatoes .
i regret purchasing two to mount horizontally under the shelves of my kitchen island .
the big issue is the blue light is very annoying
bad price for it
can't be used for anything but frying
not worth the money, could easily be without it .
i bought this as a gift for my brother and he hated it .
why doesn't it have a wider design for different foods .
i can t believe how nice this ice cream maker is
you've probably seen these products too often on iron chef .
i use this somehow as a small office supply shelf
It's more powerful, so I expect it to be too loud .
i also hate it because the jar is plastic .
very ugly unit, hard to assemble and difficult to operate .
Tablet's charge like a snail, I expected better .
they were horrible and they don't work i hate them a lot .
i paid too much $ for this when I bought a few other pieces .
the cookbook that comes with it is terrible .
The bottom most container is smaller than you'd think .
Not sturdy with a bad selection of teeth sizes .
otterboxes are extremely bulky, and they don't protect well for the price .
i ve had this thermometer for just num_num years
and it s much much expensive than getting it at the cusinart parts site .
somehow fair price . x x x x x x x x xx x
I dislike it more then any of the forman items .
I will never have a phone with an otterbox again .
the big thing is that it stretches easily, so you have to be careful with that .
with grandchildren, this is a horrible combo of color and functionality
slightly better than block and tackle type hooks to store overhead
For this price, this is not a good buy .
bento spoon is poor choice
: pi also have very limited space in my kitchen .
i purchased the frieling to try to replace a glass bodum press that broke
one corner is slightly taller than the other and it is noticeable .

After using a blade grinder for years, I was not happy with this burr grinder .
it charges my phone very slowly and to an incomplete % battery .
the copper finish is coated with a not nice to see plastic to prevent oxidation
make sure the pins don't line up with the contacts .
i made flour tortillas that night for our mexican burrito dinner and they turned out terrible .
more creative than num_extend dont think so ! but still somehow a good product
it does not fulfill my modest requirements , and does not meet my expectations in appearance .
way overpriced
upset at purchase from the start
the handle is comfortable enough and holds the pitchers in your hands

i dislike that this griddle doubles as an indoor grill .
I use these reviews so heavily that I don't want to give back .
adds a huge amount of bulk to your phone
hard to keep clean and a real piece of junk .
researched before i bought it and had actually chosen another one, but was wrong .
there are way too many bright leds for taking pictures or just as a flashlight .
this happened after only a couple of days of use .

the blade weight and thickness of the wustof was definitely better
bad charger, too expensive
not perfect results until hitting upon a good cookbook
the loops do not stop any accidently lost or intentional disappearance .
This stylus does not make the game easy to play .
I wouldn't even give these measuring spoons as a stocking stuffer for a college student .
i have read reviews from wine experts that it doesn't work at all .
I had many problems with both pieces and don't recommend the products .
it is somewhat difficult to clean or assemble
one feature is that the spatula head is removable for cleaning
I completely doubt that it will hold up even for a few weeks .
plus it is amazon and they will put there name on any piece of junk
this doesn't cuts down on waste that much but you don t have to ingest harmful propellants
oxo is the worst
i really don't like how this counter protector curves over the edge of the counter .
